Application Layers 
1. Class Modules: This directory contains reusable modules and classes such as global variables and Db Helper that are utilized across the application for enhanced code maintainability and re-usability. 
1. Crud Queries: This directory centralizes all CRUD queries, which are called and executed in the Data Access Layer (DAL), improving query management and reducing code redundancy.
1. 3. DAL: This directory serves as the intermediary between the application and the database, executing all queries, including CRUD operations. It ensures secure and efficient access to the database, improving application performance and reliability. 4. MVVM: This directory implements the MVVM pattern, separating presentation logic from business logic, improving application scalability and maintainability. It ensures a clear separation of concerns and enables faster and more flexible development. 5. Schema Queries: This directory contains different directories that represent TBU s and are responsible for creating schema queries for each data table. It centralizes schema management, reducing complexity and increasing data consistency. 6. Service Layer: This directory centralizes API calls through a class named cm Http Calls, enabling efficient and consistent API access throughout the application. It ensures that all API calls are well-managed, improving application performance and reliability. 7. Validation: This directory centralizes field validation, ensuring data accuracy and consistency. It ensures that all user input is validated efficiently and accurately, improving application reliability and user experience.
